# Wordle-Solver
Just a quick wordle solver I whipped up in a day. It recommends you words for your first guess and tells you what to guess for each consecutive word based on the grey, yellow, and green tiles that show up. I also performed frequency analysis on the bank of words accepted by wordle and the program should ouput the most likely word given wordle's own bank of words

``python3 solver.py``
